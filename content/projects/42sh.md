# 42sh, a linux shell

## What, When, Who?
This is the biggest project I had to do yet, the last project of our first year at Epitech.
It was a group project with  my classmates [@AnonymusRaccoon][] [@Octopus773][] [@Melefo][] [@Arthi-chaud][].

42sh is a linux shell, we had to reproduce the behavior of [tcsh][].
After that we had the freedom to add bonus features.

## My part
First, I had to do some builtin commands from the shell like
which and where
![whichcommand](/carbon.png)
And the scripting part of the shell.
Launching a script with

./script.sh
source script.sh

I didn't achieve to handle conditionals and loops with the if and for in a script before deadline.

## What I learned
I did learn a lot during this project especially from my peers. First time using Github to handle a project.
We used issues and pull requests which I now use daily. AnonymusRaccon also set up a CI to handle the tests when we
merge to the master branch and also push the master branch to the git repository for the school.
Learning to use Github was by far the biggest thing I learned during this.
