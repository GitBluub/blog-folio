# BlogFolio, a tech blog, a portfolio

##  Why would I do this project?

I think a portfolio is an easy answer, simply putting putting myself
and my experiences/projects forward. The blog on the other part is not
something all developers do so this deserves a little bit more explanation.

I have 2 main goals with this. First, I discover a lot of things and want to
share them. These posts are most likely to be about a new tech (for me) I'm currently trying. Second is to develop my writing skills, I feel like this is an
exercise I need. You can clearly see this when reading this text.

## What I used

I started the blog with Nuxt following this [guide][].
I chose Nuxt because it is a Vue library and I want to get better at coding with Vue and because it helps me to deliver blog posts from markdown files with nuxt/content

For the styling, I tried the css framework [Tailwindcss][]. It was a very good experience and I think I will use it more often. Works very well with Vue and React because you will set css rules via class names of the html element so you can
style the component directly from the template.

## What I learned

In this project I learned about [Tailwindcss][] and Nuxt. It was mostly a discovery
of these tech for me. I also learned more about Markdown syntax because I'm writing these blog posts and projects page in Markdown so I am now more familiar with it. Last thing I learned was static page deployment as I'm hosting this project on my github page.

## What I ~~would~~ will change

It is my first iteration of this site and I am sure I will change it soon.
I feel like the styling is okay but not as professional as I would like it to be.
Also I used nuxt/content to render my project pages with markdown but it will limit me a lot in making more complex pages. Also I don't need the ability to make infinite project pages on a portfolio. I would never put more than 6.
I am trying threeJS soon so I might use that for a more creative portfolio.
I might keep the blog like this with some minor changes.
